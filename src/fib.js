/*
  Let's start us off with a class recursion example--Fibonacci.

  The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
  Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

  The fib function takes in a number *n* and returns an array representing
  the Fibonacci sequence with a length of the given number *n*.

  Emphasis on the array. Typically, we see fib only returning the number in the sequence, but
  we want the entire array up to that point.

  Let's ignore fib(0) and simply start with fib(1). Assume n will always be an integer equal or greater
  than 1.
